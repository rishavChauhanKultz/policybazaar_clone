# policybazaar_clone

Hello everyone, Hope all are doing good. I am going to share my unit-5 construct week project experience. As a part of the curriculum, we built a project in the path of learning of every unit to become good developers. In the unit-5 project, we cloned a Policy Bazaar. I worked with a five members team.

Policy Bazaar is an insurance selling website that provides multiple company insurance on a single web portal from 5Lac upto 1crore.

In every unit of the Masai curriculum, we learn new frameworks and implement them in our projects. In unit 5, where we learned the backend part of web development frameworks how the data is stored using Redux and how it retrieves to the front end using Reactjs MongoDB, Express and Node.js.
